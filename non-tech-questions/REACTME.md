- ### What are your weaknesses?

    <details>
    <summary>Sample Ans: </summary>

  > I find I am often too critical of myself and the work I produce, which can make it difficult for me to accept praise. At my last job, I was told I'd be receiving company-wide recognition for a project I had just completed, and I felt I had not done as well as I should have. Initially, I felt I should turn down the opportunity to be recognized, however, I realized that I had done work I should be proud of and that I should use my self-criticism to push myself to do better on the next project.
